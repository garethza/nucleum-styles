# nucleum-styles
A code powered styling system for Sketch that uses the 'Puzzle Tokens' Sketch plugin to generate an *updateable* style guide using LESS to reduce time spent manually updating text and layer styles. Simply change your master variables for font and colour choices and have the changes automatically replicate throughout all your Sketch libraries - magic! 

Along with global text styles (In all colours, line heights, and weights) there are unique styles for things such as buttons, cards, navigation and forms which always have more unique styling compared to the global text styles.
